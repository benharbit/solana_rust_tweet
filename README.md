This repository is an implimentation of a tweet program on the Solana blockchain.  
The program creates a token.  One can write a tweet, like a tweet or 
dislike a tweet.  One has to pay the tokens to like a tweet and the
owner of the tweet receives the tokens.

There is also a Rust and Typescript client which allows one to use the
tweet program.

programs/mySolanaProgram/src/lib.rs contains the solana program
